## Achievements

During milestone 2, our team was able to implement the majority of the features that were preconceived in milestone 1.

Specifically, we were able to come up with the following visualizations from our original four plotting ideas:

1. `Visual 1: Life Expectancy by country` Displays the selected metric in a global map for the filtered regions and year.
2. `Visual 2: Income vs Life Expectancy` Seamlessly displays the bubble chart for GDP vs. the selected metric for the filtered regions and year.
3. `Visual 3: Top 10 Countries` Shows the list of top 10 countries for the selected metric (descending order) for the filtered regions and year.
4. `Visual 4: Life Expectancy group by Income` Displays box plots that show the distribution of the selected metric for each income group for the filtered regions and year.

Furthermore, our group took the initiative to build in additional metrics for visualization in our dashboard.  Originally, we had planned to just include life expectancy, but our dashboard now includes the capability to also visualize child mortality and population density.  All of our graphs dynamically change as the user filters through these three metrics. Lastly, we were able to implement the filters `Continent`, `Sub Region`, and `Year` filters that we had planned previously as well, in addition to the `Metric` filter just discussed. Again, all of our graphs are dynamic and change their displays according to the filters selected. One small point worth mentioning is that we diverted from our original plan to have a `Country` filter.  Rather, we found that the `Sub Region` filter as it was more relevant to the visualizations that we were building, so we did not implement the `Country` filter.

## Future Improvements

Our dashboard is working as we had originally planned, and displays some very useful summaries on selected metrics for the intended user group such as researchers, sociologists, and demographers. One feature that we are hoping to achieve soon is the ability for the global map (visualization 1) to highlight only specific part as the `Sub-Region`, after the `Region` is selected. We are hoping to have this feature implemented by the end of this project term. We are also looking to improve the graphs to have more interactive features if deemed appropriate, for instance, displaying the actual statistics when hovered over the graphs. We may also change the themes and overall presentations of the dashboard as we progress through the course.
