# Reflection

## Achievements

Our team was able to implement most of the features that were preconceived during the milestone 1. We were able to come up with the visualizations for all of the following four plotting ideas: ‘Visual 1: Life Expectancy by country’ displays the life expectancy in a global map for the filtered regions. ‘Visual 2: GDP vs Life Expectancy’ seamlessly displays the bubble chart for GDP vs life expectancy. ‘Visual 3: Top 10 Countries’ shows the list of top 10 countries in terms of life expectancy. ‘Visual 4: Child Mortality Dist’ shows the box plots separated by the income group. Furthermore, our group took another step and included additional metrics to show not just the life expectancy, but also the child mortality and population density. All our graphs will dynamically change as the user filters through these three metrics. Lastly, we were able to implement the filters that we had planned previously as well, having ‘Region’, ‘Sub Region’, and ‘Year’ filters in addition to the ‘Metric’ filter just discussed. Again, all our graphs are dynamic and will change their displays according to the filters selected. One small point worth to mention is that we changed our original plan to have ‘Country’ filter to include ‘Sub Region’ instead as it was more relevant to the visualizations that we were building. 

## Future Improvements

Our dashboard is working as we had originally planned, displaying very useful summaries on selected metrics for the intended user group such as researchers, sociologists, and demographers. One feature that we are hoping to achieve soon is the ability for the global map (Vis 1) to zoom in and out according to the ‘Region’ or ‘Sub Region’ selected. We are hoping to have this feature implemented by the end of this project term. We are also looking to improve the graphs to have more interactive features if deemed appropriate, for instance, displaying the actual statistics when hovered over the graphs. We may also change the themes and overall presentations of the dashboard as we progress through the course.
