## Research questions you are exploring

Jen is a demographer and sociologist who studies the social determinants of health and mortality. Her research seeks to explain differences in life expectancy and health over the life course across populations.

She is conducting research on the recent trends in life expectancy across high-income countries and wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the effect of recent adverse trends in life expectancy on the US's overall life expectancy standing with other high-income countries.

This application shows an overview of the life expectancy across high-income countries over time. She can [filter] the data based on the region she is interested in the high-income countries, and the time period she is interested in the last 20 years.

When Jen logs on to the “mindthegap”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her dataset, according to the desired country, sub-region and single year. She can filter out variables for head-to-head comparisons. When she does so, Jen may notice a recent decline in life expectancy in most high-come countries simultaneously and the fact that the USA is falling further and further behind its peer countries in the last 20 years. She hypothesizes that different facts may be driving the declines in life expectancy in the USA compared with other high-come countries, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study since the cause of death coding across countries is not captured in her current dataset.
