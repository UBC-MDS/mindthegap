## Team Work Contract

### Expectation:
* The time expected for group members to work on the  project will be a maximum of 6 hours unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected. If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Friday 6pm) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased. 
* All members should create their own branch and work on their code base on their branch. Respond to assigned/tagged git issues within 24 hours from the time of creation.
Members should update the group slack channel every alternate day regarding the progress made or difficulties incurred. 
* All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

### Meetings:
* Meeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 2022-02-15. 
* Meetings will be held virtually on zoom on every Tuesday (2pm-4pm) and every Thursday (7:30pm-8:30pm) 
* We can set up any ad-hoc virtual session to discuss if needed. 
All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make it to a meeting, she/he should intimate on Slack 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.

### Communication:
* All communication outside of the meetings shall be on Slack or Github. Github will be used as the primary communication tool for sharing ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. 
* All informal communication can be done on Slack channel.
* Reviews:
  * All members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.
  * All Merge and push requests to the main branch must be notified on the group slack channel and seek prior approval before committing.
* Roles:
  * There are two roles the team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:
    1. Contributor:
       - Responsible for writing and fixing the codebase and necessary documentation
    2. Reviewer:
       - Responsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.
       - Responsible  for reporting any issues on GitHub issue and give prior notification to the teammates that are responsible for the task

### Deadlines:
Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The reviewers will review the work on Thursday evening and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

### Breach of Contract:
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

1. A written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. A meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
3. To reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammates.
